# Hi there, I'm Cristian! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about data science, machine learning, and using data to solve real-world problems. Here, you'll find projects that reflect my journey in data science, from data wrangling and visualization to predictive modeling and machine learning.

## About Me
- 📚 I'm a student at the **University of Connecticut** pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Science** and **Statistical Data Science**.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **big data technologies**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **data science projects** and **open-source contributions**.
- 💬 Ask me about **data analysis**, **machine learning**, or anything related to coding and technology.

### Current Project:
I'm currently working on a web dashboard that ingests historical market data, backtests strategies (equal-weight, mean-variance, constrained optimization), and produces actionable portfolio allocations and performance reports — built with Python (Pandas, SciPy/cvxpy), interactive visualization (Plotly/Streamlit), and deployed for demo.
